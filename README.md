# Silence

No logs instant chat messages.

This is an extremly simple web based messaging app with very limited javascript (just enough to show websocket messages).

There is no user/login/auth, no rooms/private messages, and no message history, there is just a single global chatroom.

When a user connects to the chatroom he receives a random short UUID which is colored on the frontend, every time the page is reloaded the UUID changes, it's not linked to any data, and is randomly generated by the backend.

## Deploy

Run container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/deoktr/silence:latest
```

Visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Systemd

Silence supports systemd socket files listener.

```bash
go build .
chown root:root silence
mv ./silence /usr/bin/silence
```

In `/etc/systemd/system/silence.service`:

```systemd
[Unit]
After=network.target
Requires=silence.socket

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/silence

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

In `/etc/systemd/system/silence.socket`:

```
[Unit]
BindsTo=silence.service
Description=silence socket listener

[Socket]
FileDescriptorName=silence
NoDelay=true

```

Then set up a reverse proxy like Nginx in front, don't forget to proxy websocket.
